\subsection{Context}
The IT resources deployed in the data centres contributing to WLCG are an important source of expense for funding agencies.
With the expected amount of data to be recorded at HL-LHC, it is highly desirable for WLCG to estimate the
amount of IT resources that will be available for data processing in sites over time.
Simple projections from the current trends in the IT market, assuming a constant budget in sites over time, indicate that
the available amount of resources across the WLCG will not be sufficient at all to process the HL-LHC data (reference?).
Therefore, it becomes clear that, unless technology revolutions happen in the meantime,
LHC experiments will need to make a different usage of IT resources that sites will deploy.

The purpose of site cost estimations is to understand and measure, at a global scale,
what the data centres typical expenses are, and predict what they may be in years from now.
The approach chosen in this context is to model those expenses, taking into account the diversity of national contexts
across sites in terms of funding, procurement procedures, and local market conditions.
These results will help experiments plan new computing strategies that
will improve the cost-effectiveness of their resource usage.

\subsection{First results}

Some of the first elements to address are the diversity of expenses across sites, and the definition of what these
expenses are.
A simple and quick exercice was made by four candidate sites, aiming to get a first estimate of the financial cost to run
a given workflow and to store a given amount of data, in terms of IT resources and power consumption.
The answers to this exercice happened to be significantly different from site to site, up to a factor of 2.
The reasons were found to originate from different aspects: the intrinsic variety of costs, the measurement method, and
the understanding of what a given metric means.

Those results showed clearly the need of a consolidated and common model and method to measure costs across
WLCG data centres.
Here are a few examples to illustrate this point. One may consider the cost of a server providing a given capacity,
including (or not) the equipement that is shipped with it (rack, switch, adaptor etc.).
One may also consider that one TB of tape storage includes (or not) the needed investment for library, drives, disk cache
that is needed for such system to work properly.
Finally, the measurement of an electrical consumption may include (or not) the Power Usage Effectiveness of the data center
to take into account UPS or HVAC system contributions to the final power bill.

Consequently, it becomes fundamental in the context of site cost
estimation to establish precise definition of the cost-related metrics in order to build a strong model.

\subsection{Next steps}

A preliminary attempt to address data center resource TCO through cost modeling was shown in reference~\cite{costmodel}.
