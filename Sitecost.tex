The IT resources deployed in the data centres contributing to WLCG are an important source of expense for funding agencies.
With the expected amount of data to be recorded at HL-LHC, it is highly desirable for WLCG to estimate the
amount of IT resources that will be available for data processing in sites over time.
Simple projections from the current trends in the IT market, assuming a constant budget in sites over time, indicate that
the available amount of resources across the WLCG will not be sufficient at all to process the HL-LHC data (reference?).
Therefore, it becomes clear that, unless technology revolutions happen in the meantime,
LHC experiments will need to make a different usage of IT resources that sites will deploy.

The purpose of site cost estimations is to understand and measure, at a global scale,
what the data centres typical expenses are, and predict what they may be in years from now.
These results will help experiments plan new computing strategies that
will improve the cost-effectiveness of their resource usage.
