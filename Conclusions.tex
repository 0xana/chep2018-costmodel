\section{Conclusions}
The WLCG/HSF joint working group on systems performance and cost
modelling has started only recently, but it is already active on
several of the issues that need to be addressed in order to fulfill
our computing challenges in the coming years. This involves pursuing
performance and efficiency gains in all aspects of software and
computing, optimising the usage and the purchase of resources and
exploring new ideas in a quantitative way. Collaborations are in place
with other activities in the HEP community, including HEPiX for
benchmarking~\cite{hepixbm} and technology aspects, the WLCG DOMA
working group and the rest of the HSF.

The work we described clearly indicates that
substantial gains are achievable, provided that adequate effort is
invested.  The activities of the working group will continue, not only
to further develop our understanding of the cost of LHC computing and
its evolution, but also to increase the knowledge and the awareness of
cost and performance issues in our community.
